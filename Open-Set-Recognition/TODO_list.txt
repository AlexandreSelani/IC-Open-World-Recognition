1. three stage training:
    init centroids, training model, refine radius.
2. the disentangled feature map like DNL in distance branch.
3. DFPloss.py line 33, to all or to the closest non-gt centroid.
4. In loss. we use sigmoid to rescale the loss. If a better way?

BUG: OLTR fea_criterion need an optimizer.

# what about normalization to deal with the extremly distance problem.
